# Editor.js Tool â€” starter kit package

Single command helper to generate a Tool template.

## Usage

Use `create` command to generate Tool's starter kit.

```
npm create @editorjs/tool <tool-name>
```

## Development

In templates there is a variable that will be replaced with user's input:

- `VAR_TOOL_NAME` â€” tool name
